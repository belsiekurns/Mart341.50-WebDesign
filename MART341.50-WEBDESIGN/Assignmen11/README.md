1. External CSS Style Sheet
The page is styled using an external CSS file. This keeps the HTML and CSS separate, making everything more organized and easier to work with. By linking the stylesheet in the <head>, the HTML stays focused on content, while all the styling details are handled in one place.

2. Hover Effects
Hover effects are added to the navigation menu and footer links, so when you hover over them, the color changes smoothly. This makes the page feel more interactive and lets users know which parts are clickable, adding a bit of polish to the experience.

3. Self-Hosted Font
The header uses a unique self-hosted font, which adds personality to the page and makes the main title stand out. This font is stored locally, which means it’s imported directly into the CSS and makes the page look a bit more custom.

4. External Font from a Library
For the main text, I used the Roboto font from Google Fonts. It’s a clean, readable font that pairs well with the custom header font, giving the page a cohesive, professional look.

Additional Techniques

1. Experimenting with Font Styles
Different fonts are used for the header and body text to create a visual hierarchy. This makes it easy to find key sections, like the title and subheadings, because they’re styled to stand out from the regular text.

2. Adjusting Font-Weight
To help guide the eye, bold fonts are used in certain areas like the navigation links and subheadings. This makes them pop a bit more and draws attention to important parts of the page, like the links.

3. Text Decoration
Links are styled without underlines by default, but an underline appears on hover in the footer. This gives the page a cleaner look while also ensuring links are easy to spot when you hover over them.

4. Adjusting Spacing
To improve readability, I adjusted line height and letter spacing slightly. This small change makes the text more comfortable to read, especially for the instructions and lists.

5. Aligning Text and Elements
The main content is centered and given padding, creating a cleaner layout. This keeps everything visually balanced and helps users stay focused on the instructional steps without distractions.
