<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<hr />

<h3>Online Skincare Store</h3>
    <p>This website will offer a selection of skincare products made from Indigenous ingredients like sweet grass, buffalo tallow, sage, and peppermint. I want to create a friendly and welcoming space where customers can learn about the natural benefits of these ingredients. Each product will share its story and the traditions behind it, helping everyone feel more connected to indigenous practices</p>

<h3>Cultural Wellness Blog</h3>
    <p>This blog will share wellness practices inspired by Native American traditions. <br/>I want it to feel friendly and welcoming, so readers can connect with their own wellness journeys. I will include personal stories, tips, and information on Indigenous languages, plus videos of elders and ceremonies. This way, people who want to learn more about the culture can find helpful resources. My goal is to build a supportive community that makes wellness and cultural understanding easy for everyone.p>

<h3>indigenous Medicine Website</h3>
    <p>This website will be a helpful resource for anyone interested in herbal remedies from Native American culture. I will provide clear articles, how-to videos, and easy recipes for making natural skincare and health products at home. While the skincare store focuses on beauty, this site will dive deeper into healing for the body, mind, and spirit. My goal is to make these topics easy to understand, so everyone can embrace herbal wellness in their lives</p>
