<h1> Online Skin Care Boutique </h1> 
<p>I chose this website because I personally am Native American, and have grown up being taught and uses natural resources from the earth for thhings like rashes or acne. I would like to do this website to share with people more personale, natural, and healing skin care items and provide stories on why our people used these and how they found them.</p>
<h3>Cultural Wellness Blog</h3>
<p>I had this idea because when I moved off the reservation, I lost touch with my culture and language. While Missoula is very Native Friendly, not all places have much accessibilty to cultural resources. I think considering this, It would be amazing to have a blog for people in situations like these, or people who do not have these resources at their fingertips in general. This will promote a lasting effect and could help save dying cultures.</p>
<h4>Cultural Wellness Blog</h4>
<p>I chose this idea because it is similar to the skincare store, but much more broad. <br/> This takes aspects from both ideas, and combines them. This could teach people about natural healing remedies that our ancestors used, such as peppermint, licorice root, etc. It can incorpoate healing, and also provide videos of elders practicing our ways. This creates a platform to store these ways so they can be used for years, since most of our ways are oral and die with our elders.</p>
