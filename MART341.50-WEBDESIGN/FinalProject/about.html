                    Kelsie Burns is from the Blackfeet Reservation in Browning, Montana. Kelsie comes from a six-generation family legacy of rural indigenous entrepreneurs, so combining business acumen with indigenous principles comes naturally to her. She is a current student at the University of Montana, where she is pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration with a minor in psychology. Kelsie plans to use her knowledge to support entrepreneurs and business owners from the reservation in a trauma-informed way. Despite still being a student, Kelsie was a big part of developing and designing courses for Native Women through the Native Women Launch program. Kelsie is also a certified bookkeeper, where she is both the bookkeeper and the administrative assistant for Blackfeet Eco Knowledge, a non-profit focused on cultural revitalization. As a project manager for the REAL Women Co-lab, she supports and empowers female rural entrepreneurs in all aspects of their business, which is what she is truly passionate about.
