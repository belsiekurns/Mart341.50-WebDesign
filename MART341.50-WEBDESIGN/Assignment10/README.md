What I Did This Week
Must-Have Techniques:

External CSS Style Sheet
What I Did: I set up a style.css file for all my styles.
Why It Matters: This keeps my HTML nice and tidy, plus it makes it super easy to update styles across different pages.
Class Selector
What I Did: I used a class called .hero-image to style my main image.
Why It Matters: It lets me control how that image looks without messing with others.
ID Selector
What I Did: I didn't use any IDs this time, but I plan to for unique elements later on.
Why It Matters: IDs are great for styling elements that only show up once, like the main title.
Extra Techniques I Tried:

Different Background Colors
What I Did: Made the body a light grey (#f4f4f4) and the header and footer a nice green (#4CAF50).
Why It Matters: These colors help separate sections and keep things looking fresh!
Different Font Colors
What I Did: Set the text in the header and footer to white and the main text to dark grey (#333).
Why It Matters: This combo makes everything super easy to read against those backgrounds.
Text Alignment
What I Did: Centered the footer text and adjusted my headings to keep things balanced.
Why It Matters: Centered text looks clean and guides the readerâ€™s eye where it needs to go.
Margins and Padding
What I Did: Used margins and padding to create space around sections and content.
Why It Matters: This helps reduce clutter and makes everything way easier to read.
Grid Layout for Gallery
What I Did: Set up a grid display for my gallery using display: grid; for a responsive look.
Why It Matters: It helps the images fill the space nicely and stay organized on different screen sizes.
