In my new page, I created a recipe section to showcase some of my favorite Native American wellness practices. I used divs to group different parts of the content, making it easier to manage the layout. Each recipe is within its own div, which helps keep things organized and visually appealing. I also added spans to highlight key ingredients or tips within the recipes, making them stand out for readers. I included iframes to embed tutorial videos, which will help visitors understand the cooking techniques better. To make the recipes more engaging, I added images with descriptive alt text for accessibility. Finally, I linked this new page back to my main blog and other relevant pages, so it's easy for users to navigate around. Overall, these techniques come together to create a user-friendly and informative recipe page that reflects my passion for cultural wellness.
