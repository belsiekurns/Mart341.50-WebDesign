#How to Sew a Simple Skirt

##Materials Needed:
Fabric (lightweight cotton or preferred material)
Elastic band (for waistband)
Measuring tape
Fabric scissors
Pins or clips
Sewing machine (or needle and thread if sewing by hand)
Iron
Safety pin
Instructions:
Step 1: Measure and Cut Your Fabric

Start by measuring your waist and desired skirt length. For a gathered skirt, measure fabric length to be 1.5–2 times your waist measurement for a fuller look. Cut the fabric accordingly, leaving about an inch extra on each side for seams.

Step 2: Prep the Fabric

Lay your fabric out on a flat surface. Iron it to remove any wrinkles and make it easier to work with. This will help your cuts and folds stay even throughout the process.

Step 3: Sew the Side Seam

Fold the fabric in half widthwise, with the right sides facing each other. Pin or clip along the raw edge of the fabric, then sew a straight line down the edge, leaving about 1/2 inch seam allowance. Iron the seam open to make it lay flat.

Step 4: Create the Waistband Casing

Fold the top edge of the skirt down about an inch and a half (or wide enough to fit your elastic comfortably). Pin this fold in place, and sew along the bottom edge of the fold, leaving a small opening to insert the elastic later.

Step 5: Insert the Elastic

Attach a safety pin to one end of the elastic band. Use the safety pin to guide the elastic through the waistband casing, ensuring it doesn't twist. Once through, overlap the elastic ends by about an inch, sew them together, and close the opening in the waistband casing.

Step 6: Hem the Bottom of the Skirt

Fold the bottom edge of the skirt up about half an inch, then fold it again to hide the raw edge. Iron the fold to keep it in place, then sew along the edge to secure the hem.

Step 7: Adjust and Finish

Give the skirt a quick once-over, adjusting any fabric that may have twisted while sewing. Make sure the waistband is evenly gathered and sits flat.

Step 8: Try It On and Enjoy!

Slip on your new skirt to check the fit and length. Make any adjustments if needed, then enjoy your new handmade piece!

Additional Tips:
For a pop of color, consider adding decorative trim or lace along the hem.
Choose elastic that’s comfortable but snug enough to hold the skirt in place.
If you’re using stretch fabric, sew with a stretch stitch to avoid breaking threads.
