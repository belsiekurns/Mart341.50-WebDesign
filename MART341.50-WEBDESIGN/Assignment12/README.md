# Assignment12 - Client Services Page  

**HTML File:** `index.html`  

## Techniques Used  

### 1. Semantic HTML  
I used semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to structure the page. This improves accessibility and makes the code easier to read.  

### 2. CSS for Styling  
I applied CSS properties to create a clean, professional design.  
- **Colors:** Used a purple theme for branding consistency.  
- **Typography:** Applied a sans-serif font for readability.  
- **Spacing:** Added padding and margins to balance whitespace and avoid clutter.  

### 3. Responsive Design  
The page is designed to look good on all screen sizes by using flexible widths and a centered layout.  

### 4. Buttons and Links  
I styled buttons and links to make them more interactive and visually appealing. Hover effects were added for better user experience.  

### 5. Box Shadows and Borders  
Added subtle shadows to sections for depth and a modern look. Rounded borders make the design softer and more inviting.
