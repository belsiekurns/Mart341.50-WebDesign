I'm really proud of how my website combines visual appeal with accessibility. I chose a clean layout with earth tones to create a welcoming vibe, which feels connected to the themes of cultural wellness. Plus, I included descriptive alt text for images, making it easier for everyone to engage with the content. Overall, I think these design choices help create a space where visitors can feel at home while exploring Native American wellness practices!
