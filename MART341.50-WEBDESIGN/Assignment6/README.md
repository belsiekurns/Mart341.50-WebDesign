I’m going to focus on the Cultural Wellness Blog because I love the wide array of topics I could cover. I want to create a friendly space where people can connect with Native American wellness practices. I plan to keep the tone warm and inviting, making it feel like a supportive community for anyone on their wellness journey

For my Cultural Wellness Blog, I focused on balance by changing the width and background color of some parts. I set the background color to snow, which gives a nice, clean look and helps the content stand out. Adding padding around the main content made it feel more spacious and easier to read.

My final design is pretty close to what I imagined at first. I thought it would look more crowded, but by playing around with the padding and colors, I ended up with a layout that looks nice and balanced. The purple headings really pop without being too much.

One challenge I had was making sure the text was easy to read against the background. Some color combos didn’t work well together, so I kept testing until I found ones that looked good. Balancing the layout was also tricky at first, but using padding helped a lot to give everything enough space.

Overall, this assignment showed me how small changes in CSS can really improve the look of a site!
