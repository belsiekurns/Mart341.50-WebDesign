For this project, I created a website with multiple pages to make it easy for people to navigate. The pages include a Home, About, Services, and Contact page, all with a cohesive theme. I used Bootstrap to give the site a nice, consistent layout and added styling components like navigation bars, grids, and buttons to make it look clean and professional.

I also included an HTML5 canvas element on the homepage. It was a fun way to showcase a custom design, adding a bit of interactive flair. For JavaScript, I added a contact form with a "mailto" link, which lets users send me an email directly from the site.
