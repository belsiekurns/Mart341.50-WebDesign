#Assignment3
## What problems did you have? How did you solve them?
### The biggest problem I had was on assignment 2 when I incorrectly made my repository, and instead started with just a folder. I rewatched the assignment 2 demonstration and was able to correct my mistakes and make a new repository, file, and redo assignment 2 along with assignment 3. I did see your feedback, so this is me letting you know I fixed the problem and re submitted, thank you for correcting me on that. 
My to do list this week is
- study and finish chapter 4.
- Work a launch event for work.
- Clean my apartment and car.
- Attend in person class.
- Grocery shop.
